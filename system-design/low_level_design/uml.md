Why use class diagrams?

The following are some important purposes of the class diagram:

- Represents the system's static structure.
- Directly maps with object-oriented languages.
- Represents what the system's duties or responsibilities are.

Uses in both forward and reverse engineering.

Class Notations:

    - A class is represented by a rectangle with three sections:

        1. name
        2. attributes
        3. methods

    - Interface, abstract class, and enumeration

        - <<enumeration>>
        - <<Abstract>>
        - <<interface>>
        - <<annotation>>

    - Access modifiers:

        - `+`: public
        - `-`: private
        - `#`: protected

    - Association:

        - Class association
            - Inheritance

        - Object association
            - Simple association
            - Composition
